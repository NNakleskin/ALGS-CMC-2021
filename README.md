# CMC MSU Algorithms and Data Structures Course, 1st semester, C tasks

This repository contains my solutions to programming tasks for the Algorithms and Data Structures course in the 1st semester at the Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics department of Moscow State University (CMC MSU). The tasks are implemented in C and are organized by the contest number and problem name.

The repository contains directories for each contest, where each directory contains the C source code files for the corresponding task.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference and to compare against your own solutions. However, please do not copy them directly, as that would be a violation of the academic integrity policies of CMC MSU or your institution.
